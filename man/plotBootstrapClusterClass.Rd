  Plot results of bootstrapClusterClass
  %%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
  %%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
  Generates plots from a bootstrap clustering classification. The plots
  show the results of the classification on the original data, with
  additional information on the uncertainty in the classification
  derived from the bootstrapping.

\usage{
plotBootstrapClusterClass(bootClass, bootBoundaryAlpha = 0.05, subjectID = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{bootClass}{
    A list of bootstrap classification results from
    \code{bootstrapClusterClass}. 
  }
  \item{bootBoundaryAlpha}{
    An alpha at which to plot the (two-sided) bootstrap confidence
    interval on the cluster boundary. 
  }
  \item{subjectID}{
    Optional vector of subject IDs, used for making the bar plot.
    The vector should match the length and ordering order of latencies
    passed to \code{bootstrapClusterClass}. If IDs are not specified, the
    subjects are numbered in ascending order.

\details{
  %%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
  Three plots are generated by this function, entitled respectively

  \enumerate{

    \item Initial clustering and bootstrap probability of stress resilience
    
    This scatter plot shows the results of the classification on the
    original data set. The cluster boundary is drawn as a solid line. 
    
    The dashed lines indicate the range of values for the boundary over
    all bootstrap iterations. The default \code{bootCurveAlpha} of 0.05
    results in the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile being plotted.
    
    
    \item Stress resilient cluster boundary over all bootstraps

    This histogram plots the classification threshold. The boundary is
    defined as halfway between the SL subject with the longest latency, 
    and the LL subject with the shortest latency.

   
    \item Bootstrap stress-resilience probabilities

    This bar plot shows, for each subject, the LL probabilities derived
    from the bootstrap. The bootstrap probabilities are defined as the
    probability the subject will be classified as LL for a given
    bootstrap. Thus if a subject is LL in 900 out of 1000 bootstraps,
    its bootstrap probability is 0.9. The color of the bars indicate the
    initial classification on the original data.
